# Simple Shop Program
# Using exception handling code blocks such as try/ except / else / finally, write a program that simulates a customer in a shop
# (NB: the more code blocks the better, but try to use at least two key words e.g. try/except, raise)
# Tasks:
# Create a dictionary with a minimum of 3 items and prices
# One of the items needs to cost more than £100
# Customer’s available money is £100
# Welcome the customer and display the items and their prices, along with an option to “exit” 
# Accept the option as an input, an invalid input should raise a ValueError 
# If the customer can afford it, print out a message saying “Here’s your {item}!” 
# The user should be then greeted out of the shop, and the program terminated.
# If the customer cannot afford it, note the attempt and ask if they have more money, if they do and enter the amount it should be added to the balance.
# The purchase should be tried a maximum of 3 items, if it fails a custom error should be raised and the customer will exit the shop.
