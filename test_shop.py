# Write unit tests for your Simple Shop Program in Task 3.
# You may need to refactor your function in Task 3 to ‘untangle’ some logic into smaller blocks of code to make it easier to write tests.
# Write at least 5 unit tests in total covering various and appropriate cases. 
# An expected test will see your custom error being raised.

# Test functions that determine if the user's funds are sufficient to make a purchase.
# Testing if the shop correctly deducts the purchased amount from the user's available funds.
# Testing when the user has exactly the right amount of money to make a purchase.
# Testing when the user has insufficient funds to buy *any* item.
# Negative Tests: Create tests to verify how the shop handles invalid inputs or exceptional cases for item names
# Testing when the user enters non-numeric values for quantities or funds.
